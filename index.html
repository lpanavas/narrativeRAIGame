        <h1>Welcome to the AI Risk Assessment Game</h1>
        <p>
            You are an EU tech regulator, tasked with the essential duty of categorizing AI technologies based on their potential risks. The risk levels to choose from are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Unacceptable:</b> Applications of AI that manipulate human behavior, exploit the vulnerabilities of a specific group, and other uses which could lead to physical or psychological harm. These uses are prohibited.</li>
            <li><b>High:</b> AI applications which could cause significant risks, such as biometric identification, critical infrastructure, education, and employment. They require a risk management system before implementation.</li>
            <li><b>Low:</b> AI applications posing minimal risk to individuals or society. They are largely unregulated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In this game, each correct categorization earns you 2 points. Be careful though, mislabeling a high-risk application loses you 3 points, and if you mislabel an unacceptable application, you lose all your points. If unsure, you can choose not to label an application, which will still earn you 1 point.

        <p>
          As a newly appointed AI regulator for the European Union, you are
          tasked with the crucial responsibility of determining the risk level
          of various AI technologies in use today. This is no small task and
          requires considerable knowledge and manpower.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, resources are limited and you must strategically choose where
          to allocate them. At the start of your mandate, you have been given 6
          points that you can allocate to either expertise or manpower. Each of
          these resources comes with its own advantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Expertise Points:</strong> These points represent the depth
            of your knowledge about AI technologies. The more points you have,
            the more detailed information you will have access to when
            evaluating a technology. To upgrade your expertise simply click the upgrade knowledge button. You can upgrade your knowledge twice per turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Manpower Points:</strong> These points represent the size of
            your team. A larger team can review technologies faster, giving you
            more time to make decisions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <ul>
